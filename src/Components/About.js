          I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at New
          Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), with an expected graduation
          date of Dec. 2024.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I have developed a strong passion for computer programming,
          acquiring skills in a range of programming languages and technologies
          including SQL, GitHub, JavaScript, Java, C++, C, Python, Numpy,
          Matplotlib, PyTorch, Jax.
          <br></br>
          My main focus is Web Development as it is in my opinion a critical
          role in 2024. I am currently learning ReactJs, Node.js, Express and
          MongoDB to fine tune my full stack developer skills. I have applied
          these skills in several projects, notably creating a web application
          using HTML/CSS, JavaScript (jQuery), PHP, ReactJs.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I am actively seeking job or internship opportunities that
          will allow me to leverage and further develop my skills, and
          contribute to the advancement and innovation in the field.
