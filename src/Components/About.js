          I recently graduated from the New Jersey Institute of Technology with
          a Bachelor's in Computer Science
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I have developed a strong passion for computer programming,
          acquiring skills in a range of programming languages and technologies
          including: <br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>C </li>
            <li>C++ </li>
            <li>Java </li>
            <li>Python </li>
          </ul>
          My main focus is Web Development as it is in my opinion a critical
          role in 2024. I am currently learning ReactJs, Node.js, Express and
          MongoDB to fine tune my full stack developer skills.
          <br></br>I have applied these skills in several projects, notably
          creating a web application using:
          <ul>
            <li> HTML/CSS </li>
            <li> Javascript </li>
            <li> PHP </li>
            <li> Coldfusion </li>
            <li> ReactJs </li>
            <li> ExpressJs </li>
          </ul>
          I am actively seeking full time employment opportunities in
          software/web development
